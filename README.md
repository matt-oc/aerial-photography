# Aerial Photography Waterford
Website for aerial/drone photography company.

## UX

### Project Goals

The Goal of Waterford Aerial Photography is to create an easy to use, intuitive website that portrays all of the information a potential customer might want in a format that encourages the user to contact/ take the next step towards becoming a customer. The user should be able to easily understand the services provided and have an idea of how their own job may turn out.

There are 2 main roles involved, the goals of the potential customer using the site and the goals of the business.

#### User Goals

* To find out if this business can help them with what they are looking for.
* Easily obtain contact information.
* View samples/examples of previous work.
* A website that works on all devices and screen sizes to easily refer back to.
* Gauge the price of a potential job.
* Find out what kind of equipment is used.

#### Business Goals

* To convert potential customers into customers.
* Provide adequate example images/videos to demonstrate past work and provide high quality RAW samples for download.
* Have contact information readily available and a form to allow contact without leaving the page.
* Engage users immediately and encourage them to browse further.
* Give the customer a clear understanding of what the business does/does not do.
* Provide information about pricing.
* Display equipment/ licences the business uses.

#### User Stories

As a user of Waterford Aerial Photography I want to:

* Easily find contact information.
* View plenty of sample images to get a good understanding of the level of work.
* Clearly understand what the company can/can't help me with.
* Get an idea of pricing without having to make contact first.
* Understand the areas in which the company operate geographically.
* Have social media links to get more perspective.
* Be able to easily navigate the site.
* Not be bugged by popups or ads.

### Design Choices

The decision was made to have the site as a single scrolling page with separate content areas. This is due to the relatively modest size of each section and the fact it is easier to scroll than it is to click links. This gives the website a fuller look while also making it easy to navigate.
